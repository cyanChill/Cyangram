### Admin Panel

When logged in as **the admin** user, going to `<site url>/admin` url will bring up the admin panel page. There, you can delete a user, post, or comment from knowing its id.

> **It's important to make sure you set the `ADMIN_ID` environment variable to the user that will have admin privileges.**

> The admin account will function like a normal account as well.

## Features

This utilizes NextJS which allows us to do both the back and frontend in the same project. The backend is done through the `/api` page routes. I utilized MongoDB for the general storage of everything and Firebase for image storage.

> **Currently, we limit the use of the app to authenticated users (ie: users with an account).**

> We also utilize **reCaptcha V3** to verify signup requests.

### Messaging

- "Realtime" Messaging â€” to prevent pinging our backend too much, we have it update every 30 seconds (this can be changed in `components/pageLayouts/messagingPages/conversation.js` file by changing the `REFRESH_TIME_MS` varaible).

### User Profile

- Edit profile (Profile Picture, Username, Name, Password, Bio, Delete Account)
- Follow/Unfollow People

### Posts

- Home feed with option to show posts from those we follow or a discover feed
- Create/delete posts
- Like & comment on posts
- Get sharable link for posts

### Search

### Themes & Layout

- Supports Light/Dark Modes
- Mobile-friendly
